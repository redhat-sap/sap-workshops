## Prepare Access to Lab environment

Before you provision your lab environment you want to make sure that you can connect to your servers after the provisioning. This can be achieved via ssh public-keys or kerberos.

### Setup SSH on Linux and macOS
To access the jumphost via SSH, open a terminal, locate the private SSH key in your email, and store it in e.g.`~/.ssh/mylabkey` and change the rights to user read-only:

----
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/mylabkey
----

Now use the command in your email to login to the jumphost, e.g.:

// ----
// $ ssh cloud-user@bastion-zxgdg.zxgdg.dynamic.opentlc.com -i  ~/.ssh/mylabkey
// ----
//or
----
$ ssh ec2-user@bastion.GUID.example.opentlc.com -i ~/.ssh/mylab
----

To make sure the right key is used, add `-i path/to/your/key` to the command in the Email.

NOTE: Unless otherwise noted, you cannot use SSH to connect directly as root.
