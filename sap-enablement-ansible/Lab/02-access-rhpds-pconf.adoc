== Access to Lab environment

You are running this lab from our preinstalled Laptops.

You should just have to SSH to the bastion host of the lab using the default SSH key in the partner conference laptop home directory.
The partner conference laptop user is lab-user and we will create a lab-user on the Ravello based hosts.

So all you need  to SSH into your bastion is:

----
ssh workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----
