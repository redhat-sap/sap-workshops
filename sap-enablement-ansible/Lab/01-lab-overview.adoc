=== Base Requirements to access and perform this lab

* A computer with access to Internet :-)
* SSH client (for Microsoft Windows users link:https://www.putty.org/[Putty] and link:https://winscp.net/eng/downloads.php[WinSCP] or link:https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html[MobaXterm] is recommended)
* Firefox 17 or higher, or Chromium / Chrome

=== High-level architecture and components

The high-level architecture consists of 4 different RHEL 8.x servers with the following purposes:

* bastion: this is meant to be used as the jump host for SSH access to the environment
* tower: this is meant to be used as the Ansible and Ansible Tower host where to run the automation from
* hana1, hana2: this is meant to be used as the RHEL server where to deploy SAP HANA
* s4hana: this is meant to be used as the RHEL server where to deploy SAP S/4HANA

=== Environment request

This environment is provisioned using the Red Hat internal demo system. We at Red Hat embrace the use of https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/everything-as-code/[IaC] (Infrastructure as Code) for any lab/demo set up, thatâ€™s why we have open-sourced the Framework (based in Ansible) we use for this. If you want to get more information on this topic, check the https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd[AgnosticD] repository we use to deploy these labs and demos.

If you are a Red Hat Advanced or Premium Partner, you can immediately deploy this environment yourself, following the next steps. If you are participant in a workshop, this lab may be preprovisioned for you and you can continue with the next chapter "Prepare Access to Lab Environment". The information to access the environment will be given to you during the workshop.

==== Order catalog item

Login into https://rhpds.redhat.com[Red Hat Product Demo System] and navigate to `Services --> Catalogs --> All Services --> RHEL Platform Demo`. An item called `SAP End to End Automation AWS` will be available.

==== Environment info and credentials

Once the environment has been provisioned, you will receive an email with some key information:

* SSH information to access the bastion host including:
** SSH user information
** Bastion public hostbane information
** SSH private key to be used
* Ansible Tower information including:
** Ansible Tower public URL
** Ansible Tower user
** Ansible Tower Password

==== Working the Labs

You might have guessed by now this lab is pretty commandline-centric... :-)

* Don't type everything manually, use copy & paste from the browser when appropriate. But don't stop to think and understand... ;-)
* All labs where prepared using vi, but feel free to use your favoutite editor.

TIP: In the lab guide commands you are supposed to run are shown with or without the expected output, whatever makes more sense in the context.

TIP: The command line can wrap on the web page from time to time. Therefor the output is separated from the command line for better readability by an empty line. *Anyway, the line you should actually run should be recognizable by the prompt.* :-)

// ==== Challenge Labs
//
//You will soon discover that many chapters in this lab guide come with a "Challenge Lab" section. These labs are meant to give you a small task to solve using what you have learned so far.
//The solution of the task is shown underneath a warning sign.
