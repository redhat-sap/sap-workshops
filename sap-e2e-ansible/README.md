# SAP E2E Automation
> Automating SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA end to end using Ansible and Ansible Tower

## Intro

This workshop/demo can be used to demonstrate end to end automation for both HANA and S/4HANA using Ansible and Ansible Tower.

## High-level architecture and components

The high-level architecture consists of 4 different RHEL 8.x servers with the following purposes:

- bastion: this is meant to be used as the jump host for SSH access to the environment
- tower: this is meant to be used as the Ansible and Ansible Tower host where to run the automation from
- hana: this is meant to be used as the RHEL server where to deploy SAP HANA
- s4hana: this is meant to be used as the RHEL server where to deploy SAP S/4HANA

## Environment request

This environment is provisioned using the Red Hat internal demo system. We at Red Hat embrace the use of [IaC](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/everything-as-code/) (Infrastructure as Code) for any lab/demo set up, that's why we have open-sourced the Framework (based in Ansible) we use for this. If you want to get more information on this topic, check the [AgnosticD](https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd) repository we use to deploy these labs and demos.

### Order catalog item

Login into [Red Hat Product Demo System](https://rhpds.redhat.com) and navigate to `Services --> Catalogs --> All Services --> Workshops`. An item called `SAP End to End Automation` will be available.

You will find 2 different Catalog Items for this workshops, prefixed with the target infrastructure where this will be deployed, this is 'OSP' or 'AWS'. Please **use always the OSP version** and only use AWS if the OSP version fails to deploy.

![rhpds-catalog](img/rhpds01.png)

Click on the **order** button, check the confirmation box and click on **Submit**.

### Environment info and credentials

Once the environment has been provisioned, you will receive an email with some key information:

- SSH information to access the bastion host including:
  - SSH user information
  - Bastion public hostbane information
  - SSH private key to be used
- Ansible Tower information including:
  - Ansible Tower public URL
  - Ansible Tower user
  - Ansible Tower Password


## How to run the demo/workshop

The goal for this demo is to showcase how we can make SAP Solutions deployments easy and reliable using Ansible automation. To be able to demonstrate this, a Tower Workflow has been configured that will do the following:

1. Enable all the required repositories to be able to deploy SAP software in RHEL
2. Configure all the File Systems and mount points required while installing SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA
3. Install SAP Host Agent
4. Run all the OS pre-requisites from SAP Notes for RHEL systems while deploying SAP workloads
5. Run all the OS pre-requisites from SAP Notes for RHEL systems while deploying SAP HANA
6. Run all the OS pre-requisites from SAP Notes for RHEL systems while deploying SAP Netweaver software
7. Deploy SAP HANA
8. Deploy S/4HANA by SAP

Just by 'clicking a button' all these steps will be done automatically by Ansible Tower using a Tower Workflow. The final result will be an SAP landscape in RHEL with SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA installed, configured and running.

![e2e-tower-full-workflow](img/tower-full-workflow.png)

The whole lab can be run as a quick demo, to show the end to end automation or as a workshop depending on the audience, the time and the level of detail you want to show from the lab.

### Running as a quick demo

When running as a quick demo, the first thing you need to do is login into the Ansible Tower web interface and launch the Workflow Template `SAP HANA and S/4HANA E2E deployment` that is already available. SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA installation process will take a long time (the whole end to end process will take 40 minutes), so you need to ensure the Tower Workflow is running in the background while you explain the key components of the setup.

Once you show how the process is run with just 'one-click' you can briefly explain all the required set up to be done in Ansible Tower. As explained before, Ansible Tower will run a collection of different playbooks in the HANA and S/4HANA RHEL hosts to prepare, deploy and configure the software. These are covered by point 1 to 8 as previously mentioned. Ansible Tower needs to be configured the same way we configure a typical Ansible Host that is going to manage remote hosts. Ansible Tower allows the user to add this information from a Web Interface, which is very useful for people with no previous experience with Ansible or people who don't feel comfortable using a terminal. Ansible Tower also provides a very powerful REST API that can be used to configure and performs multiple actions in Ansible Tower remotely from external systems or applications.

For the quick demo, you can navigate through all the required configurations to be done to be able to set up and run the Tower Workflow from the demo.

#### Credentials

In order Tower to run Ansible Playbooks in remote hosts, the credentials required to access these hosts via SSH must be configured. On the left pane click on `Credentials`. This will show you all the actual credentials configured in Ansible Tower. One credential called `ssh-key` is already configured. This is a `Machine Type` credential that will contain the user information and SSH private key to be able to connect to the remote hosts via SSH.

![e2e-tower-workflow-credentials-gif](img/tower-workflow-credentials.gif)

#### Inventories

Ansible inventories are one of the key components required while automating IT. The inventory will contain the logical information of the hosts and all the required variables we need to use with the multiple Ansible Roles and Playbooks. On the left pane click on `Inventories`. This will show you all the actual inventories configured in Ansible Tower. An inventory called `sap-hosts` is already configured. This is the inventory we are using with all the Roles and Playbooks used by the Tower Job Templates.

To see more information about the inventory, click on the `sap-hosts` inventory and this will open another view where to see detailed information about the hosts, groups and variables configured. All the variables required have been configured already and these have been applied on the corresponding levels. Variables that are common to all the inventory hosts can be seen on the first screen when you click on the `sap-host` inventory. Once you are in the screen where this mentioned common variables appear (`sap_domain`, `sap_hostagent_installation_type`, etc...) you can click on the `HOSTS` button all the hosts configured under the inventory appear on the screen, `hana` and `s4hana` in this case.

![e2e-tower-workflow-inventories-gif](img/tower-workflow-inventories-01.gif)

You can now check the specific variables applied to the host clicking on each one and scrolling or expanding the variables field.

![e2e-tower-workflow-inventories-gif](img/tower-workflow-inventories-02.gif)

#### Projects

Ansible Tower projects a logical collection of Ansible playbooks. Using Tower projects you can manage playbooks and playbook directories by either placing them manually under the Project Base Path on your Tower server or by placing your playbooks into a source code management (SCM) system supported by Tower. The last is the approach used here, where projects will pull the information from GitHub.

All the projects are pointing to the same [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-tower-projects). This is a multi-branch repository where each branch is keeping different playbooks using different Ansible Roles.

When configuring SCM based Tower projects, this information (git URL and branch) we have provided is used to pull the information from each branch.

On the left pane click on `Projects`. This will show you all the Tower projects configured. There is an equivalency between the number of projects configured and the Ansible Roles used. Each project will provide a Playbook from the mentioned GitHub repository, and this Playbook will use a Role to run each step of the Tower Workflow.

![e2e-tower-workflow-projects-gif](img/tower-workflow-projects.gif)

#### Job Templates

Tower job templates are definitions and set of parameters for running Ansible jobs. In other words, it will use Playbooks from Tower projects explained in the previous step with hosts from selected inventories.

On the left pane click on `Templates`. This will show you all the Tower job templates configured. As previously explained, there was an equivalency between the number of projects and Ansible Roles used here. If you click on any of the configured job templates, you can see that every job template is using the Playbook `play.yml` from a different project, which points to a different branch on the GitHub repository previously explained. That playbook will use a specific Ansible Role (Red Hat Supported System Roles and Community Roles from Red Hat's SAP CoP) to perform the required actions to get the hosts from the inventory to the desired state.

![e2e-tower-workflow-templates-gif](img/tower-workflow-templates-01.gif)

As an example, let's review the whole flow:

- `sap-hostagent` job template is using `play.yml` Playbook from `sap-hostagent` project which includes the `redhat_sap.sap_hostagent` Role as part of the Playbook
- `sap-hostagent` project is using `https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-tower-projects.git` repository specifically on the `sap-hostagent` branch
- `sap-hostagent` branch from that repository contains the playbook `play.yml` previously mentioned and a `roles` directory containing a `requirements.yml` file
- `requirements.yml` file contains the reference to `redhat_sap.sap_hostagent` Ansible Galaxy Role
- Ansible Tower will automatically pull that Role dring the job template execution, so this can be used by the `play.yml` Playbook

#### Workflow Templates

Tower Workflow job templates link together a sequence of disparate resources that accomplishes the task of tracking the full set of jobs that were part of the release process as a single unit. It allows you to create pipeline-like strategies to automate your IT landscape.

Same as Tower job templates, you can access workflow templates by clicking `Templates` on the left pane link. It is easy to differentiate a `Tower Job Template` from a `Tower Workflow Template`. On a first view, you can already see the tag that Tower adds close to the template name, and these can be `Job Template` and `Workflow Template`. Also, you will see an extra icon for the workflow templates, like a hierarchy chart. This icon represents the visualizer link for the workflow.

![e2e-tower-workflow-templates-gif](img/tower-workflow-templates-02.gif)

As you can see from the animated image, once you click on the workflow visualizer you will get an overview of the existing workflow steps representing all the stages in our automation pipeline. This workflow visualizer can be used as well t modify the existing flow, adding and removing steps or change the logical order and actions happening before and after every step.

#### Showing results

As the final step for this quick demo, we will show the results from the workflow execution we did when we started the demo. Remember that the workflow has been executed in the background while we were showing all the components and by this time it should be completed.

The first thing to show is the workflow results itself. To do that, on the left pane click on `Jobs`, this will show all the Tower jobs that have been executed or are still running. Find the last `Workflow Job` that has been executed, it is called `SAP HANA and S/4HANA E2E deployment` preceded by a number that is used to identify the job id. If you click on this job, it will take you to the job details information, where you can see the status, when it did start and when it did finish. The whole pipeline to prepare the hosts, deploy and configure HANA and S/4HANA should take 30-40 minutes. If you check the right pane from that window you will see the workflow visualizer with all the nodes (steps in the pipeline) in green, representing that correct execution of the whole workflow.

![e2e-tower-workflow-review-gif](img/tower-workflow-review-01.gif)

Now we can login into the `hana` and `s4hana` hosts to validate this is true. 
Using the logon instructions email you received, login into the `bastion` host as `cloud-user` or `ec2-user` (check instructions from your email as will differ depending the target infrastructure where the lab has been deployed):

```bash
# Example for AWS environments where user is `ec2-user`
$ ssh -i /path-to-your-ssh-key ec2-user@bastion-<GUID>.<DOMAIN>
[ec2-user@bastion ~]$
```

```bash
# Example for OSP environments where user is `cloud-user`
$ ssh -i /path-to-your-ssh-key cloud-user@bastion-<GUID>.<DOMAIN>
[cloud-user@bastion-<GUID> ~]$
```

Once you have logged into the `bastion` host, ssh to the `hana` hosts:

```bash
# Example for AWS environments where user is `ec2-user`
[ec2-user@bastion ~]$ ssh hana1
[ec2-user@hana1 ~]$ sudo -i
[root@hana1 ~]$ su - rheadm
```

```bash
# Example for OSP environments where user is `cloud-user`
[cloud-user@bastion-<GUID> ~]$ ssh hana-<GUID>
[cloud-user@hana-<GUID> ~]$ sudo -i
[root@hana-<GUID> ~]$ su - rheadm
```

And execute the following as `rheadm` user to check all the SAP HANA processes are running in the system:

```bash
hana:rheadm> HDB info

```

Once we have validated SAP HANA is installed and running, login into the `s4hana` hosts:

```bash
# Example for AWS environments where user is `ec2-user`
[ec2-user@bastion ~]$ ssh s4hana
```

```bash
# Example for OSP environments where user is `cloud-user`
[cloud-user@bastion-<GUID> ~]$ ssh s4hana-<GUID>
```

And execute the following to check all SAP S/4HANA processes are running in the system:

```bash

We should see all the `sapstart` processes running along `dw` processes that will handle user requests.

We have demonstrated that we can use Ansible to automate SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA deployments end to end **with just one click!!**

### Running as a Workshop

When running as a workshop, the steps are very similar to the quick demo steps, but since this will be a workshop format, we should spend more time on each step explaining in detail how it works and going deeper into the technical components that are required to achieve the end to end automation for SAP HANA and S/4HANA.

Depending on the workshop length you may want to start launching the Workflow Template `SAP HANA and S/4HANA E2E deployment` as explained in the quick demo instructions. This will run the end to end process to automate SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA deployment on the target hosts. You can review the workflow progress at any time clicking on the `Job` link from the left pane and checking the last job called `SAP HANA and S/4HANA E2E deployment` as explained in the quick demo steps.

The flow for the workshop will be very similar to the quick demo. Please review the quick demo guide as we are going to focus here only in the differences, which is giving a bit more context of the process itself, external resources (Ansible Roles) used to achieve the end to end automation and building the end to end Tower workflow from scratch.

#### Ansible Roles

As you could imagine at this point, all the automation used for this process is built using Ansible. We are going to use 2 different types of Ansible Roles here, Red Hat supported Ansible Roles and Community supported Ansible Roles.

##### Red Hat Supported Ansible Roles

[Red Hat Supported Ansible Roles](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4488731) (a.k.a System Roles) will prepare the RHEL hosts to deploy SAP software as well follow all the SAP Notes required to deploy SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA. To do this, Tower projects have been configured to consume these roles:

- Project `storage` is pointing to branch `storage` from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-tower-projects/tree/storage)
- Project `sap-preconfigure` is pointing to branch `sap-preconfigure` from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-tower-projects/tree/sap-preconfigure)
- Project `sap-hana-preconfigure` is pointing to branch `sap-hana-preconfigure` from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-tower-projects/tree/sap-hana-preconfigure)
- Project `sap-netweaver-preconfigure` is pointing to branch `sap-netweaver-preconfigure` from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-tower-projects/tree/sap-netweaver-preconfigure)

All these Tower projects will be consumed by the following Tower job templates:

- Job template `sap-storage` will use `play.yml` playbook that will include the role `storage` that will be pulled automatically on the playbook run from the instructions described in `roles/requirements.yml`
- Job template `sap-preconfigure` will use `play.yml` playbook that will include the role `sap-preconfigure` that will be pulled automatically on the playbook run from the instructions described in `roles/requirements.yml`
- Job template `sap-hana-preconfigure` will use `play.yml` playbook that will include the role `sap-hana-preconfigure` that will be pulled automatically on the playbook run from the instructions described in `roles/requirements.yml`
- Job template `sap-netweaver-preconfigure` will use `play.yml` playbook that will include the role `sap-netweaver-preconfigure` that will be pulled automatically on the playbook run from the instructions described in `roles/requirements.yml`

Check on the following example for one particular Ansible Role so you can understand and explain the flow for the others:

##### Community Supported Ansible Roles

[Community Supported Ansible Roles](https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat_sap) will subscribe to the RHEL hosts where SAP HANA and S/4HANA will be deployed, as well deploy and configure both. To do this, Tower projects have been configured to consume these roles:

- Project `sap-rhsm` is pointing to branch `sap-rhsm` from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-tower-projects/tree/sap-rhsm)
- Project `sap-hostagent` is pointing to branch `sap-hostagent` from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-tower-projects/tree/sap-hostagent)
- Project `sap-hana-deployment` is pointing to branch `sap-hana-deployment` from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-tower-projects/tree/sap-hana-deployment)
- Project `sap-s4hana-deployment` is pointing to branch `sap-s4hana-deployment` from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-tower-projects/tree/sap-s4hana-deployment)

All these Tower projects will be consumed by the following Tower job templates:

- Job template `sap-repositories` will use `play.yml` playbook that will include the role `redhat_sap.sap_rhsm` that will be pulled automatically on the playbook run from the instructions described in `roles/requirements.yml`
- Job template `sap-hostagent` will use `play.yml` playbook that will include the role `redhat_sap.sap_hostagent` that will be pulled automatically on the playbook run from the instructions described in `roles/requirements.yml`
- Job template `sap-hana-deployment` will use `play.yml` playbook that will include the role `redhat_sap.sap_hana_deployment` that will be pulled automatically on the playbook run from the instructions described in `roles/requirements.yml`
- Job template `sap-s4hana-deployment` will use `play.yml` playbook that will include the role `redhat_sap.sap_s4hana_deployment` that will be pulled automatically on the playbook run from the instructions described in `roles/requirements.yml`

Similar to the previous screen recording, you can browse all these projects and job templates, to understand and show how they are related and how the Ansible roles are pulled from their source repositories to be used during the job template execution.

#### Inventory variables

As explained during the quick demo section, Ansible inventories are key components while using Ansible automation. Now you are familiar with all the Ansible roles that are used for the end to end automation here, you should review the `README.md` file for each role's GitHub repository, where the required variables and more information on how to use the role is explained.

As an example check the `README.md` file for the `sap-hostagent` role [here](https://github.com/redhat-sap/sap-hostagent). Is a good practice to name the variables required for the role prefixing those with the role name, this way we can easily identify these in our inventory. If you click on `Inventories` on the left pane and then click on the `sap-hosts` inventories, you will these variables that apply to every host in the inventory:

```yaml
sap_hostagent_installation_type: "rpm"
sap_hostagent_rpm_remote_path: "/software/SAPHOSTAGENT"
sap_hostagent_rpm_file_name: "saphostagentrpm_44-20009394.rpm"
```

The scope of these variables depends on where are those configured. In the above example, these variables apply to all the Inventory hosts; this is because we want to install SAP Host Agent on every host. But this is not true for all the roles. If we are applying particular roles to particular host or group of hosts, for simplicity and clarity, these variables should be configured on the corresponding scope. As an example, check how we are applying variables for the `sap-hana-deployment` role:

![inventory-variables-gif](img/inventory-variables.gif)

The question now is, how do we limit some roles to be applied to specific hosts or groups of hosts? Let's review this in the next section.

#### Job templates

As explained during the quick demo section, Tower job templates will execute a Playbook that is coming from a Tower Project. While explaining the Ansible roles, we have reviewed already this correspondence between available roles and the playbooks which include these roles from the different GitHub repositories.

Job templates will allow us not only to run those required playbooks but also specify where do we want to run those (using the existing Tower inventories) and provide some extra options including credentials to use, privilege escalation, concurrency and others.

We can see all this information from the job template detail. As an example we are going to check 2 different job templates, `sap-hana-preconfigure` and `sap-hostagent`. The first one is specific for the `hana` host, while the second one needs to be run on every host from our inventory since SAP Host Agent needs to be installed for both SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA:

![job-templates-gif](img/job-templates.gif)

As you can see, we are using same inventory for both, but limited to `hana` the first one to ensure `sap-hana-preconfigure` role is only applied to SAP HANA hosts and not SAP S/4HANA hosts.

#### Workflow templates

Now you understand all the pieces from Ansible Tower, the only part we are missing is the how. We have job templates ready to be run in our environment, but how we do this? We could go to each Tower job template and execute them one by one manually. But this is not very useful as we want to automate a process that takes a lot of time and we would need to wait for every job template to finish, check the results and execute the next one if the previous one was a success. Also if we repeat this many times it could be the case we miss some steps.

This is where workflow templates can help. Workflows allow creating complex automation processes that put together multiple job templates in a pipeline style allowing to decide the order these are executed and take decisions based on previous job results.

This setup already includes a Tower workflow that put all these roles together to create an end to end deployment pipeline for both SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA. By this time, the workflow you executed it should finish already and as we show on the last step from the quick demo, we will end up with the `hana` and `s4hana` hosts running the desired SAP workloads in it.

As the last exercise of the workshop, let's try to create a Tower workflow from scratch that put all the pieces together with the following logic.

1. Register the systems with the required repositories for SAP workloads
2. If previous step success, configure the required file systems and mount points for SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA
3. If previous step success, install SAP Host Agent on both systems
4. If previous step success, run the required configuration following SAP Notes to support SAP workloads on both systems
5. If previous step success, run in **parallel** the requirements following SAP Notes both for SAP HANA and SAP S/4HANA on each host
6. If previous **parallel** steps success, deploy HANA in the `hana` hosts
7. If previous step success, deploy S/4HANA in the `s4hana` hosts

In case you have the time to test this new Tower workflow, notice it will fail if you have run previously the one which is coming with Tower already. You can request a new instance of this lab to test this, creating this workflow and running it without running the one is coming with Tower.

This is how the process to create the workflow should look like:
